## Notes on network weights
The here provided weights were trained on different datasets as indicated in the filenames. For a discription of the datasets, see [our preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/29/359018).

Overview of dataset characterstics:

**Dataset 1:** 1000 Hz, eyelink 1000, mainly microsaccades, some memory saccades and blinks.

**Dataset 2:** 1000 Hz, scleral search coil, microsaccades during smooth pursuit task (sinusoidal and linear pursuit).

**Dataset 3:** 500 Hz, eyelink 1000, very small microsaccades during fixation.

**Andersson:** dataset from [Andersson et al. 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0738-9)

**Combined:** Datasets 1, 2 and 3 combined (most general network!)
